# Code Quiz

## Description

Note - attended funeral last week so ran out of time & had to submit not finished

The code quiz was created to test my own & others knowledge of JavaScript. The problem it solves is that it allows users to test their knowledge of JavaScript to help improve their knowledge. I learnt a huge amount building this, including event listeners, intervals, and much more.
